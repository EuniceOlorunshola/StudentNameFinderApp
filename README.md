# What is a StudentNameFinder App?

A StudentNameFinder App is a App that used to help professors have a ease when it comes to searching up there students name either to email them or if they just need their names  to send them individual classwork , homework , or any information that is needed.

# What is the purpose of a StudentNameFinder App? 

 The primary reason for my app is to when the user enters the student’s information it will display and it will make it easy for the user to easily find the student name instead of going through there list and clicking on each student. My app will also help the professors and teachers stay organize and they will never have to be concern about the time they have to send a email and especially if it is urgent for the student to know they can easily use my app on their mobile device and find the student information instead of going on there website and going through there list individually to find the student name and information.

# Who is the target audience of my App?

The target audience of my app is mainly based on professors and teachers, the way that this app will help professors and teacher’s daily life is that. 
When they are at school and they needed to get the information of a student but did not have time to look through their list to find the student name and click on there information.
They can easily use my app to make that process easy for them, either if it is for sending them information that pertains with the class activity or if they just wanted to email the student to send them important information such as missed classwork , homework , or anything that pertains sending it to there email. 
For professors since every student name follows by a id number, the professors can also use my app to get there students name not just by entering the student name , they can also enter the student id and that will show the student name along with there email address.
